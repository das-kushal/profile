There is a user interface for the chatbot and the admin panel in which the admin can upload rulebooks, see the 3D knowledge graph, and also overall statistics threat-level wise and also user wise specifying the duration.

    This is the final year project which I did under the guidance of Prof. Mridul Sankar Barik. The project is about converting the BPMN model to Neo4j graph database. The project is done using Python and Neo4j.
    In this project we take a BPMN model and extract the different types of nodes and relationships which have different attributes and then convert it to a Neo4j graph.
    The next part of the project was to create a web interface where the user can upload/create a BPMN model, convert into a Neo4j graph, view it and query the graph to see the results.
